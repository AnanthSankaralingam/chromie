TODOs
1. update frontend to ask for URLs
2. local updates to extension code --> minimal saves (updates to supabase)
3. fix add_to_existing prompt so that we do git diff and effectively add changes/engineer context
4. mobile friendly UI
5. Parallelize the project creation and display frontend first when generating new extension
6. Testing extension needs a way to just render html files
7. Testing extension side by side view needs option to focus on one. browser testing shouldn't be assumed.
8. display project names
