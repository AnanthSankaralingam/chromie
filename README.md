TODOs
1. test browserbase delete session
2. add scraper
3. route requests to different prompt templates - test each one. the one sentence prompt worked surprisingly well so we probably need a solid new_ext prompt and need to engineer context effectively for update_ext.
4. verify auth works in all scenarios
