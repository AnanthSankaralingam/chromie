TODOs
1. ~update frontend to ask for URLs~

3. fix token usage after initial request
4. fix follow up prompt functionality.
5. local updates to extension code --> minimal saves (updates to supabase)
6. fix add_to_existing prompt so that we do git diff and effectively add changes/engineer context
7. mobile friendly UI
8. Parallelize the project creation and display frontend first when generating new extension
9. Testing extension needs a way to just render html files
10. Testing extension side by side view needs option to focus on one. browser testing shouldn't be assumed.
11. display project names
