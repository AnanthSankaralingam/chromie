TODOs
1. ~test browserbase delete session~
2. add scraper
3. route requests to different prompt templates - test each one. the one sentence prompt worked surprisingly well so we probably need a solid new_ext prompt and need to engineer context effectively for update_ext.
4. ~verify auth works in all scenarios~
5. add icons for extension to use. see if possible to not start at about:blank
