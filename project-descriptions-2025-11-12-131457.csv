# Browser Extension PRD: QuickClip ## 1. Executiv...,"# Browser Extension PRD: QuickClip ## 1. Executive Summary - **Extension Name**: QuickClip - **Purpose**: A browser extension that allows users to highlight any static text on a webpage and save both the text and the current URL to a sidebar clipboard with a single click. Users can then easily add saved content to any text field at their cursor location. - **Target Users**: Researchers, students, content creators, and professionals who need to collect information from various web sources. - **Key Features**: - Text highlighting with a single-click save option - Automatic URL capture alongside highlighted text - Persistent sidebar to view and manage saved clips - Quick insertion of clips into any text field - **Success Metrics**: Installation rate, daily active users, user retention, and positive user feedback ## 2. Problem Statement - **Current Pain Points**: Users often need to manually copy text, switch to another application, paste it, then return to copy the URL separately. This disrupts workflow and can lead to lost context or attribution. - **How Your Extension Solves These Problems**: QuickClip streamlines this process by enabling users to highlight text and save both the text and its source URL to clipboard in a single action. - **Existing Solutions**: Current solutions like Evernote Web Clipper, OneNote Clipper, and various bookmarking tools exist but typically require multiple clicks or save to their own ecosystems rather than the clipboard. - **Your Unique Value Proposition**: QuickClip focuses solely on simplicity and speed - one highlight, one click, and both text and URL are ready to paste anywhere. ## 3. User Personas - **Primary User**: [Name, demographic, technical skill level, goals, frustrations] - **Secondary User**: [If applicable] - **Edge-case Users**: [Any specific user groups with unique needs] ## 4. Functional Requirements - **Core Features** (Must Have): - Text Highlighting: Users can highlight any static text on a webpage. - Single-Click Save: Upon highlighting, a small button appears exactly where the mouse-up event occurs that saves both the text and URL to the sidebar when clicked. - Sidebar Clipboard: A persistent sidebar that stores all saved text snippets with their source URLs. - Insert Feature: Ability to insert any saved clip at the current cursor position in any text field. - Visual Feedback: Users receive clear visual confirmation when content is saved. - **Secondary Features** (Nice to Have): - Format Options: Allow users to choose between different output formats (plain text, markdown, HTML). - Search: Search functionality within saved clips. - Keyboard Shortcuts: Save highlighted text and insert clips via keyboard. - Dark Mode Support: Ensure the sidebar and UI elements work well in dark mode. - **Future Enhancements** (Post-initial release): - Cloud Sync: Optional sync of saved clips across devices. - Organization: Ability to categorize or tag saved clips. - Annotation: Add personal notes to clips before saving. - Export: Export all saved clips as a document. ## 5. Technical Requirements - **Supported Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge (initial release), Safari (future release) - **Browser API Requirements**: - Selection API (for text highlighting) - Clipboard API (for copying text and URL) - Context Menu API (optional) - Storage API (for options and history if implemented) - **Permissions Required**: - clipboardWrite (to copy to clipboard) - activeTab (to access the current page content) - storage (for options and history features) - **Data Storage Requirements**: - Local storage for user preferences - Optional sync storage for history feature if implemented - **Performance Requirements**: - Button must appear within 200ms of text selection - Copying action must complete within 100ms of click - Extension should consume minimal memory when idle - **Third-party Dependencies**: - None for core functionality - Optional: Small UI library for formatting options (if implemented) ## 6. User Interface and Experience - **UI Components**: - Browser Action (toolbar button): Icon that opens the sidebar when clicked - Copy Button: Small, unobtrusive button that appears near highlighted text - Sidebar Panel: Main interface showing saved clips with options to manage them - Success Indicator: Brief visual feedback when saving is successful - Options Page: Page for customizing formats and behavior - Context Menu Items: Optional right-click options for saving and inserting - **User Flows**: - Primary Flow (Saving): 1. User highlights text on a webpage 2. Save button appears near the highlighted text 3. User clicks the button 4. Text and URL are saved to the sidebar 5. Brief visual feedback confirms success 6. Button disappears when selection changes or page is clicked - Secondary Flow (Inserting): 1. User places cursor in a text field 2. User opens sidebar (if not already open) 3. User clicks on a saved clip or the ""insert"" button next to it 4. The clip is inserted at the cursor position - Options Flow: 1. User clicks gear icon in sidebar 2. Options panel opens 3. User adjusts settings 4. Options are saved automatically - **Design Guidelines**: - Clean, minimal interface with clear hierarchy - Sidebar: Light background with distinct item cards - Button should be visible but not intrusive - Color scheme: Blue primary (#1a73e8), with light/dark mode support - Typography: System fonts for maximum compatibility - Visual feedback should be clear but brief ## 7. Privacy and Security Considerations - **Data Collection**: [What data will be collected, if any] - **Data Storage**: [Where and how data will be stored] - **Data Transmission**: [How data will be sent, if applicable] - **User Controls**: [How users can control their data] - **Compliance**: [GDPR, CCPA, or other regulatory considerations] ## 8.

I am designing a Chrome extension for “Brady UX” —...,"I am designing a Chrome extension for “Brady UX” — a boutique UX/UI design consultancy. The extension’s purpose is to help founders, product managers and designers quickly audit any webpage’s user-experience and identify improvement opportunities, while subtly promoting Brady UX’s services. Key requirements: The extension icon appears in the Chrome toolbar; when clicked it overlays the current webpage with a semi-transparent panel. The overlay shows a quick “UX Snapshot” of the page: Highlights UX heuristics (e.g., excessive CTAs, inconsistent spacing, low contrast, unscannable copy) as red/yellow/green indicators. Shows a short bullet list of top 3 issues detected + one quick suggestion. Beneath the suggestions, include a subtle footer: “Want a full UX audit? Visit bradyux.com” (linkable) and a button “Book a free review” that opens a new tab to your services landing page. The heuristics should be configurable: in the extension’s options page the user (or you as admin) can define new heuristics with a name, description, and color-level (red, yellow, green). The UI should reflect Brady UX branding: clean typography, minimalist icon, pastel accent color, and a micro-animation when the overlay appears. The extension should be built as Manifest V3, with content scripts that scan the DOM for heuristics, compute scores, and render the overlay. No heavy backend required—everything runs in the browser. Efficiency & performance: The scanning should happen after page load, with minimal impact; if possible skip pages over a certain size or use a “Quick Scan” mode. Privacy-safe: The extension does not send page content externally; all work is local. The only external link is the “Book a free review” CTA. Publishing: Write the manifest.json, background/service worker, content script files, UI overlay HTML/CSS/JS, options page, and include README instructions for installation and publishing to the Chrome Web Store under “Brady UX Tools”. Tone and style: Use clear, designer-friendly language in the UI (“Your UX Snapshot”, “Top 3 issues”, “Quick suggestion”). The code comments and README should reflect Brady UX’s voice: thoughtful, educational, design-first. Please generate all project files and folder structure, including sample heuristics (e.g., “Too many CTAs”, “Inconsistent spacing”, “Low contrast text”), and a README that explains how to install and publish. The goal: a lightweight but polished Chrome extension that delivers value to users and positions Brady UX as the go-to expert.",true,2025-10-26T01:16:20.204+00:00,false,fca1265b-6714-4c28-8b15-cf3f04b00828,d9147527-bdb2-42e8-9eef-e6109c1aacb6
